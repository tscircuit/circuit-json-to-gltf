## Features

- Convert circuit JSON to GLTF 2.0 format (JSON or binary)
- Render PCB board with accurate dimensions and textures
- Support for STL and OBJ model loading for components
- High-quality board texture rendering using circuit-to-svg and resvg
- Automatic component positioning and generic 3D representations
- Customizable camera, lighting, and material settings

## Footprinter rotation compatibility

For models using the default footprinter loader frame, `cad_component.rotation`
is interpreted as right-handed intrinsic XYZ angles in degrees in Circuit JSON's
Z-up coordinates, matching the existing Three.js viewer interpretation. With
column vectors this means `Rx(x) * Ry(y) * Rz(z)`. The loader changes the model
frame; placement changes basis as a matrix instead of merely swapping Euler
angle fields.

Earlier exports effectively applied `Ry(-y) * Rx(-x) * Rz(z)` in those same
coordinates. X/Y tilts and mixed-axis rotations can therefore change appearance.
Unrotated models, Z-only rotations, and standard bottom-side placements
(`x = 0`, `y = 180`) retain their geometry apart from roundoff.

Projects may have compensated by negating X/Y offsets or pre-rotating assets.
For a pure-axis workaround, replace the compensating angle with the intended
right-handed angle. For combined rotations, negating two fields is not a general
migration: to preserve an intentionally chosen old appearance, convert the old
effective rotation matrix to intrinsic XYZ angles. Compare against the intended
physical orientation, rather than automatically preserving a wrong export.

This correction does not change model generation, origin selection, fitting,
units, translation, non-footprinter formats, or custom loader paths outside the
default footprinter mapping. It does not distinguish hardware from electronics.

## Installation

```bash
bun install circuit-json-to-gltf
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { convertCircuitJsonToGltf } from "circuit-json-to-gltf"

// Your circuit JSON data
const circuitJson = {
  elements: [
    {
      type: "pcb_board",
      pcb_board_id: "board1",
      center: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      width: 80,
      height: 60,
      thickness: 1.6
    },
    // ... components, traces, etc.
  ]
}

// Convert to GLTF
const gltf = await convertCircuitJsonToGltf(circuitJson, {
  format: "gltf", // or "glb" for binary
  boardTextureResolution: 2048
})

// Save the result
fs.writeFileSync("circuit.gltf", JSON.stringify(gltf))
```

## API

### Main Function

```typescript
convertCircuitJsonToGltf(circuitJson: CircuitJson, options?: ConversionOptions): Promise<ArrayBuffer | object>
```

### Options

- `format`: "gltf" (JSON) or "glb" (binary) - default: "gltf"
- `boardTextureResolution`: Resolution for board texture rendering - default: 1024
- `showPcbNotes`: Include `pcb_note*` elements in board texture rendering (default: `false`)
- `boardDrillQuality`: Drill geometry detail level, "high" or "fast" - default: "fast"
- `drawFauxBoard`: Draw a fallback board if no `pcb_board` or `pcb_panel` is present - default: false
- `includeModels`: Whether to load external 3D models - default: true
- `modelCache`: Map for caching loaded models
- `backgroundColor`: Board texture background color; overrides `pcb_board.solder_mask_color`
- `boardSideColor`: Physical substrate/edge color; otherwise derived from the solder-mask color
- `copperColor`: Exposed copper color in board textures
- `silkscreenColor`: Silkscreen color in board textures; overrides `pcb_board.silkscreen_color`
- `solderMaskWithCopperColor`: Color of traces and copper covered by solder mask; otherwise derived from the solder-mask color
- `drillColor`: Drill opening color in board textures
- `showBoundingBoxes`: Show bounding boxes for debugging (default: `false`)
- `projectBaseUrl`: Optional base URL used to resolve `node_modules` model assets via `/package_files/download`
- `authHeaders`: Optional auth headers for model downloads, e.g. `{ Authorization: "Bearer ..." }`

When a `pcb_board` supplies `solder_mask_color`, the renderer uses it for the
board surface and derives contrasting covered-copper, substrate-edge, and
silkscreen colors. Explicit conversion options take precedence.

## Architecture

The converter uses a modular architecture:

1. **Circuit to 3D Converter**: Parses circuit JSON and creates a 3D scene representation
2. **Board Renderer**: Renders PCB layers as textures using circuit-to-svg and resvg
3. **Model Loaders**: Load STL and OBJ files for component 3D models
4. **GLTF Builder**: Constructs the final GLTF using Three.js

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test

# Run example
bun run examples/basic-conversion.ts
```

## Implementation Details

- Uses `circuit-to-svg` to render the top/bottom layers of the board to SVG
- Uses `@resvg/resvg-js` to convert SVG to PNG textures
- Includes built-in STL and OBJ parsers for 3D model loading
- Pure GLTF 2.0 implementation without external 3D library dependencies
- Supports both JSON (.gltf) and binary (.glb) formats
- Embeds all assets (textures, buffers) directly in the output
